### âœ… Stability Milestone â€“ v1.4-pre Recovery
**Date:** 15 May 2025  
**Logged by:** Mother Chat 3.0  
**Context:** Major system stabilization after Git-sync issues and accidental rollbacks.

---

## ðŸ”§ Structural Changes
- App split into modules:
  - `home_screen.py`, `layout.py`, `navigation.py`, `session_manager.py`, `task_memory.py`
- Session logic isolated into `SessionManager` with unified pause/start/resume/reset flow

## ðŸ§  UX & Logic Fixes
- Fully implemented task Combobox with smart filtering
- `task_memory.json` now reliably sorted and pruned
- Resume state now syncs across all task/session fields
- Pivot-chart crash issue resolved for both mock and real data

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Outcome
- Clean codebase, fully functional UI
- All charts, timers, and task logging are operational
- Feature stacking can now resume safely from this point

**Next Step:** Begin planning and implementing Subtask Planner as a user-defined task breakdown engine.
