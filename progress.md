# 🛠️ Project Progress Journal: Pomodoro Productivity and Analytics App

---

# 📅 2025-04-28
## Update 1
**Work Done:**
- Created project folder structure:
  - assets/, pomodoro/, data/
- Moved tomato.png into assets/images/
- Created professional documentation files:
  - README.md, CHANGELOG.md, ASK.md, WORKLOG.md
- Updated README.md content to match new vision (Analytics + Task Tracking)

**Decisions Made:**
- Follow Google Data Analytics phases (Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act)
- Project will support future features like:
  - Background image customization
  - User-selected background music
  - Year-end Spotify Wrapped-style summaries

**Next Steps:**
- Create `run_app()` in app.py
- Build Tkinter window with Top, Middle, Bottom Frames
- Launch from main.py and test basic structure

**Notes:**
- Keeping documentation very clean for portfolio visibility
- Will maintain clean commit history: small commits, clear messages
## Update 2
# 🛠️ Project Progress Journal: Pomodoro Productivity and Analytics App


**Work Done:**
- Finalized project commitment: building a professional-grade Pomodoro + Analytics App
- Defined project goals clearly: modular, scalable, theme-ready, analytics dashboard
- Decided to type all code manually for deep understanding (no copy-paste)
- Discussed and planned dynamic screen switching (Home, Settings, Analytics views)
- Designed basic dynamic `run_app()` architecture:
  - Top Frame → Navigation buttons (Home, Settings, Analytics)
  - Middle Frame → Dynamic content area (switches screens)
  - Bottom Frame → Reserved for future Checkmarks and Music controls
- Setup centralized theme dictionary for future theming flexibility
- Finalized strict study approach: Read official documentation for every library used

**Decisions Made:**
- Will build everything modularly (dynamic screens, centralized styling, separated logic files)
- Will not rush — focus on deep understanding and professional development habits
- Will keep PROJECTS.md updated after every major working session (private journal)

**Next Steps:**
- Type the full updated `run_app()` manually into `app.py`
- Type clean `main.py` calling `run_app()`
- Run and test that window with navigation switching works
- Once verified working → clean Git commit + push

**Notes:**
- ChatGPT will continue serving both as project guide and strict mentor
- Documentation reading and mastery mindset is now officially part of workflow
## ✅ Update: UI Frame Navigation and Layout Fix

**🗓 Date:** April 30, 2025  
**🔧 Module:** `run_app()` – Layout and Navigation  
**🎯 Goal:** Fix frame stacking and ensure button-based navigation (Home, Settings, Analytics) with responsive layout

---

### 🐞 Issue
- Labels weren’t centered or scaling well  
- Frames not switching cleanly  
- Layout didn’t stretch/adapt properly on resize  

---

### 🛠 Fix Implemented
- Used `.grid()` with `rowconfigure` and `columnconfigure` for flexible resizing  
- Created a `middle_frame` to contain dynamic sub-screens  
- Used `tkraise()` to switch between `home`, `settings`, and `analytics` views  
- Top navigation buttons placed using `pack(side="left", expand=True)` for consistent layout  

---

### 📈 Result
- ✅ UI now switches views correctly  
- ✅ Layout adapts responsively to window resizing  
- ✅ Code is cleaner and modular for future feature expansion

---

### 🧭 Suggested Next Steps
1. **Code Functionality**: Implement actual logic for each screen  
2. **UI/UX Styling**: Polish themes, use consistent colors, consider icons or rounded corners  
3. **Analytics Planning**: Begin sketching out what usage data to collect and how to visualize it  
4. **Final Polishing**: Structure `main.py`, prepare `README.md`, and set up for GitHub

### 🧩 Major Update – UI Finalization and Timer Logic Integration  

**Work Done:**  
- Finalized and debugged full UI layout with top (navigation), middle (dynamic screens), and bottom (control buttons) frames  
- Implemented Home screen layout with:
  - Session type dropdown
  - Large centered timer label
  - “Work Session 1” session label  
- Successfully added bottom frame with horizontally aligned Start, Pause, Reset buttons  
- Integrated functional Pomodoro logic:
  - Countdown with `after()`  
  - Auto-switching between Work → Short Break → Long Break  
  - Pause, resume, and reset logic implemented  
- Set up state variables: `is_paused`, `timer_id`, `remaining_seconds`, `work_session_completed`  
- Used centralized `theme` dictionary across all widgets  
- Verified that UI and timer logic work well together  
- Identified glitch where repeated pressing of Start causes stacked countdowns  

**Decisions Made:**  
- Will modularize logic into a separate `timer.py` file  
- `app.py` will handle layout and screen switching only  
- Timer logic will be imported and connected through clean interface  
- Auto-restart at end of countdown is paused temporarily for clarity  
- Will fix multiple timer bug after logic is moved to `timer.py`  

**Next Steps:**  
- Move all timer functions (`countdown`, `pause_timer`, etc.) to `timer.py`  
- Set up import and wiring between `app.py` and `timer.py`  
- Once modular structure is stable, fix Start button glitch  
- Begin planning session logging for analytics  

**Notes:**  
- UI now feels stable and theme-consistent  
- Code structure is being prepared for long-term scalability and professional readability  
- Project now transitioning from layout/styling phase → modular logic + data tracking

### 🚀 Major Milestones – Modular TimerEngine + Session Logger

**Work Done:**
- Replaced `TimerController` with new modular `TimerEngine` class (in `timer_engine.py`)
- `TimerEngine` uses callbacks (`on_tick`, `on_complete`, etc.) to decouple logic from UI
- Refactored `app.py` to drive ticking via `after()` loop
- Simplified button handling with clean `toggle_pause()` logic
- Resolved old bugs (e.g., multiple countdowns on Start)
- Confirmed full stability with new architecture — milestone tagged as `v2.0-alpha`
- Added `logger.py` module to log sessions in `data/session.csv`
- Logger uses `Pathlib` to ensure directory exists and `csv.DictWriter` for clean appends
- Integrated logging inside `session_complete_cb()` to track session type, time, count

**Decisions Made:**
- TimerEngine is now UI-agnostic, testable, and production-ready
- Logger will remain lightweight CSV-based for now
- Will extend later with analytics dashboards and visual feedback

**Next Steps:**
- Implement duration settings from Settings screen (Spinbox → Engine)
- Add basic analytics (session summaries, daily trends) to Analytics screen
- Improve UX with animated transitions and better button feedback

**Notes:**
- App now follows a clean layered architecture: UI ↔ Callbacks ↔ Engine
- README and docs will reflect v2.0 milestone in next polish pass
- Project moving toward MVP-level completion and dashboard integration
