Daily progress journal for the Pomodoro Productivity App.

---

## 2025-04-28
**Work Done:**
- Updated README.md to reflect new project vision
- Created CHANGELOG.md, ASK.md, WORKLOG.md templates
- Planned full project structure and goals

**Decisions:**
- Follow Google Data Analytics Process (Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act)
- Plan future analytics and reporting features now

**Next Steps:**
- Commit all initial documentation
- Begin building base Tkinter window
## 2025-05-03
**Work Done:**
- Finalized and tested base UI layout with top, middle, and bottom frames.
- Implemented navigation button switching logic using `.grid()` and `tkraise()`.
- Applied centralized theme dictionary for styling consistency.
- Integrated initial countdown functionality via `start_countdown()` and `after()` method.
- Identified layout deviations caused by premature feature additions from Learning Chat.
- Re-aligned structure to match UI/UX plan before further logic integration.

**Decisions:**
- Timer logic will be preserved but temporarily decoupled from layout while UI cleanup proceeds.
- Feature additions (like session selection dropdown) will be relocated or reintroduced after design stabilization.

**Next Steps:**
- Refactor layout of control buttons (Start, Pause, Reset) to bottom frame horizontally.
- Reintroduce `Work Session` label and placeholder for tomato visual.
- Isolate and modularize timer logic.
- 
## 📅 2025-05-04 – Mid-Day Update

- Refactored `app.py` to move all timer-related logic into `timer.py` as a class-based module.
- Connected `TimerController` with GUI layout cleanly.
- Implemented `Start`, `Pause`, `Resume`, and `Reset` functionalities via buttons.
- Introduced `toggle_pause()` in `app.py` to switch Pause/Resume states with button text updates.
- Verified correct timer flow and bug-free behavior with modular design.


## 📌 Milestone – Version 1.0 (2025-05-04)

- Modular architecture implemented with separation between UI (`app.py`) and logic (`timer.py`)
- Timer logic encapsulated in `TimerController` class
- Fully functional Start, Pause/Resume, Reset buttons
- Toggle logic added to Pause button via `app.py`
- All known glitches resolved (stacked timer loops, resume issue)
- UI layout stable and styled using centralized theme
- 
## 🧱 Refactor Milestone — Version 2.0-alpha (2025-05-04)

- Replaced `TimerController` with modular `TimerEngine`
- Logic now decoupled from UI via clean callback functions (`update_display_cb`, `session_complete_cb`)
- Implemented tick-loop in `app.py` using `after()` instead of internal loops
- Enabled Pause/Resume functionality using a toggle button with internal state
- All prior bugs resolved (timer stacking, resume not working)
- System now testable without GUI dependencies

## [2025-05-04] - Added Session Logging System

**Added**
- `logger.py` module under `pomodoro/` for centralized session logging.
- Logging uses CSV file format for simplicity and analysis compatibility.
- CSV file is auto-created if missing (`data/session.csv`) and includes header.

**Changed**
- Modified `session_complete_cb()` in `app.py` to call `log_session()` with session type, timestamp, and number.

**Notes**
- This lays the groundwork for the upcoming analytics dashboard.

## 📅 2025-05-06

**Work Done:**
- Finalized `analytics.py` as production-ready module
- Integrated logic based on actual logger schema with dynamic duration support
- Implemented grouping for sessions by day, type totals, and recent summaries
- Added streak calculation (consecutive session days)
- Verified full compatibility with existing logger data

**Decisions Made:**
- Deferred task-aware `Session` tracking (e.g., `task_name`) to future milestone
- Will revisit post-MVP once core analytics and UI are complete
- Logged this plan under Mother Chat’s roadmap

**Next Steps:**
- Begin visual integration of analytics output into Analytics screen
- Connect computed summaries to UI components and dashboards

## 📅 2025-05-07

### 🧱 Refactored:
- Extracted `render_analytics_screen()` from `app.py` into a new modular file: `screens/analytics_screen.py`
- Created `screens/` directory to house modular UI definitions for each screen
- This change aligns with our earlier modularization (e.g., `timer_engine.py`) and keeps `app.py` clean and maintainable

## 📅 2025-05-07 (Midday Log)

### 🧱 Refactored:
- Moved the global `theme` dictionary out of `app.py` and into a new module: `pomodoro/theme.py`
- All GUI modules now access it via: `from pomodoro.theme import theme`
- This ensures a single source of truth for UI styling, improves modularity, and avoids circular imports

### 🧩 Planned:
- `theme_manager.py` will be used in a later phase to support dynamic theming (e.g., Light/Dark mode, persistent settings)

## 📅 2025-05-11

**Work Done:**
- Reviewed faulty external implementation of analytics layout toggle
- Rebuilt `render_analytics_screen()` to dynamically switch between scroll and dashboard layout
- Finalized brick-wall dashboard layout (`render_dashboard_layout`) with correct section grid placement
- Repaired scrollable layout with working scrollbar, mousewheel bindings, dynamic `scrollregion`
- Validated canvas resizing and element rendering across modes

**Decisions Made:**
- Toggle based on `parent_frame.winfo_width() >= 900` is sufficient for switching
- Will continue refining visuals, but layout logic is now milestone-complete

**Next Steps:**
- Begin task label selector (v1.3)
- Apply Treeview styling polish
- Explore user toggles in Settings for layout preference
"""
- ## 📅 2025-05-12

**Work Done:**
- Finalized Task Selector upgrade to a new **Task Plan** layout with session goal support.
- Added two fields: `task_var` (StringVar) and `task_session_goal` (IntVar), placed within a "Task Plan" LabelFrame on Home screen.
- Ensured UI layout harmony by slotting Task Plan into row 5 between the session label and control buttons.
- Designed the internal grid with labels and input fields for Task Name and # of Sessions, using ttk.Entry and ttk.Spinbox respectively.
- Decided that `task_var` and session goal will persist until manually changed or depleted.
- Chose not to alter logger schema — session log continues to log each Work session with the task active at that time.

**Decisions Made:**
- Auto-clearing the task field after each session was dropped in favor of letting users plan how many Pomodoros a task should last.
- Logger will not track the planned session count — only actual completed sessions per task.
- Task field remains free-form (`ttk.Entry`) for now; dropdowns and saved task lists may come in v1.5.

**Next Steps:**
- Notify Code Chat to wire up `task_sessions_remaining` logic:
  - On Start: capture task + session count.
  - On each Work session complete: decrement.
  - If counter hits 0 → clear task_var and session goal.
- Prepare for upcoming Treeview visual polish and task-aware analytics grouping.

## 📅 2025-05-13

**Work Done:**
- Implemented full Task Plan logic in `app.py`:
  - `task_var` and `task_session_goal` added as shared state
  - On Start, task name and number of sessions are captured
  - `current_task` and `task_session_remaining` tracked internally
  - After each Work session, task is logged and counter decremented
  - Task fields auto-clear when planned session count is exhausted
- Integrated into session lifecycle without altering logger structure
- Verified correct behavior across session switches (Work → Break → Work)

**Decisions Made:**
- Task and session goal fields persist between sessions by default
- Task name is only logged during Work sessions
- Field-clearing occurs only after planned Pomodoros complete
- Short/Long Breaks log an empty task by design

**Next Steps:**
- Notify Analytics Team that `task` values are now available in real logs
- Begin Treeview visual polish for the Analytics screen
- Add optional setting to remember last task name across app sessions

## 📅 2025-05-13 (End-of-Day)

**Work Done:**
- Fully integrated Task Plan logic in `app.py`:
  - Task name (`task_var`) and session goal (`task_session_goal`) inputs now operational.
  - Session logging seamlessly integrated; tasks auto-clear after reaching planned session count.
  - Ensured backward compatibility—no logger schema changes needed.
- Finalized Dashboard Analytics structure for clarity:
  - Introduced a 7-Day Activity Overview (line chart) replacing stacked bars for clearer trends.
  - Implemented placeholders for task-specific overlays and future interactivity.
- Completed a refined placeholder dashboard structure with precise `.grid()` placement:
  - `task_freq` spans multiple rows to match height visually.
  - Verified smooth toggle between scrollable and dashboard modes.

**Tech Enhancements:**
- Added `draw_line_chart()` to `charts.py` for multi-line trend visualizations.
- Expanded analytics summarizers:
  - `summarize_daily_by_type()` and `summarize_daily_for_tasks()` added.
- Enhanced mock data to fully support task analytics.

**Decisions Made:**
- Confirmed layout structure optimized for task analytics and visual hierarchy.
- Task field resets only upon reaching the specified session goal.

**Next Steps:**
- Add interactive task-selection dropdown for trend overlays.
- Complete visual polish for Treeview (spacing, colors, tooltips).
- Discuss and implement persistent task memory (most recent task name).
- Enable mock-to-real data toggling in analytics.

## 📅 2025-05-14

**Work Done:**
- Completed full implementation of final v1.3 dashboard layout:
  - Refined 3×4 grid with clear separation of task analytics, usage trends, streaks, and session history.
  - Adjusted `rowconfigure` and `columnconfigure` weights for visual hierarchy.
  - `Task Frequency` chart now spans two rows to balance height with surrounding visuals.
- Implemented new `7-Day Activity Overview` using `draw_line_chart()`:
  - Shows trends of Work, Short Break, and Long Break across the last 7 days.
  - Dropdown added to overlay task-specific trends using `summarize_daily_for_tasks()`.
- Updated scrollable layout to match new line chart and task interactivity.
- Enhanced `charts.py` with `draw_line_chart()` utility:
  - Multi-line support, clear legends, gridlines, responsive labels.
- Expanded `mock_data.py` to include:
  - Mock `per_task_time`, `task_frequency`, `daily_by_type` for all chart previews.
- Verified `use_mock=True` compatibility across all modules.

**Decisions Made:**
- Final dashboard layout approved and locked for v1.3
- Blitting enabled for smoother chart rendering
- Streak cards and chart font sizes made consistent with theme

**Next Steps:**
- Begin v1.4 milestone:
  - Trend overlay for multiple tasks
  - Treeview polish (tooltips, colors, column width)
  - Optional: persistent task tracking

## 📅 2025-05-15 – Structural Refactor & Feature Recovery

**Work Done:**
- Split `app.py` into modular files: `layout.py`, `navigation.py`, `session_manager.py`, `home_screen.py`, etc.
- Refactored `home_screen.py` with `rowconfigure(minsize=...)` to fix UI grid issues.
- Modularized bottom nav (`create_bottom_controls`) for cleaner state handling.
- Implemented a resilient, filtered `ttk.Combobox` for task input with live task suggestion.
- Cleaned up `task_memory.py`: added safe JSON loading, auto-pruning, and fallback.
- Fixed chart crash bug by ensuring pivot tables always contain expected session type columns.
- Restored full **Resume Session** logic via `SessionManager`, including persistence sync and state restoration.

**Fixes:**
- Task memory was not sorted or limited → now corrected.
- Session type dropdown previously glitched UI → now stable.
- Task tracking flow was breaking during pause/resume → now unified with `session_manager`.

**Current Status:**
- No crashes, no layout bugs, full analytics screen working, resume timer stable.
- Feature development may now resume (starting with Subtask Planner).


## 📅 2025-05-18

**Work Done:**
- Investigated and resolved a series of layout and resizing bugs affecting the analytics screen.
- Patched a `KeyError` in the scrollable view's 7-day trend chart caused by missing session type columns.
- Fixed canvas width not expanding on window resize by re-applying `canvas.itemconfig(...)`.
- Restored `on_canvas_configure` and `on_container_configure` bindings removed in a prior refactor.
- Corrected debounce logic used for layout switching; the `after_cancel()` handle was mis-scoped.
- Introduced DPI scaling adjustments for high-resolution screens using `SetProcessDpiAwareness(1)` and `tk.call(...)`.
- Final stabilization involved syncing layout logic with canvas bindings and chart logic to ensure both width and height now resize responsively.

**Decisions Made:**
- “Work”, “Short Break”, and “Long Break” traces are now always padded in the line chart for visual consistency.
- Scrollable and dashboard layout switching now uses a clean debounce trigger on window width.
- DPI scaling remains manual until layout auto-adjustments are proven stable across OS types.

**Next Steps:**
- Begin implementation of the End Session feature and incomplete session logging.
- Move forward with Subtask Planner module creation and UI toggle integration.
