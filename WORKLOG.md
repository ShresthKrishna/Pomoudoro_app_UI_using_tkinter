# üõ†Ô∏è WORKLOG

Daily progress journal for the Pomodoro Productivity App.

---

## 2025-04-28
**Work Done:**
- Updated README.md to reflect new project vision
- Created CHANGELOG.md, ASK.md, WORKLOG.md templates
- Planned full project structure and goals

**Decisions:**
- Follow Google Data Analytics Process (Ask ‚Üí Prepare ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Share ‚Üí Act)
- Plan future analytics and reporting features now

**Next Steps:**
- Commit all initial documentation
- Begin building base Tkinter window
## 2025-05-03
**Work Done:**
- Finalized and tested base UI layout with top, middle, and bottom frames.
- Implemented navigation button switching logic using `.grid()` and `tkraise()`.
- Applied centralized theme dictionary for styling consistency.
- Integrated initial countdown functionality via `start_countdown()` and `after()` method.
- Identified layout deviations caused by premature feature additions from Learning Chat.
- Re-aligned structure to match UI/UX plan before further logic integration.

**Decisions:**
- Timer logic will be preserved but temporarily decoupled from layout while UI cleanup proceeds.
- Feature additions (like session selection dropdown) will be relocated or reintroduced after design stabilization.

**Next Steps:**
- Refactor layout of control buttons (Start, Pause, Reset) to bottom frame horizontally.
- Reintroduce `Work Session` label and placeholder for tomato visual.
- Isolate and modularize timer logic.
- 
## üìÖ 2025-05-04 ‚Äì Mid-Day Update

- Refactored `app.py` to move all timer-related logic into `timer.py` as a class-based module.
- Connected `TimerController` with GUI layout cleanly.
- Implemented `Start`, `Pause`, `Resume`, and `Reset` functionalities via buttons.
- Introduced `toggle_pause()` in `app.py` to switch Pause/Resume states with button text updates.
- Verified correct timer flow and bug-free behavior with modular design.


## üìå Milestone ‚Äì Version 1.0 (2025-05-04)

- Modular architecture implemented with separation between UI (`app.py`) and logic (`timer.py`)
- Timer logic encapsulated in `TimerController` class
- Fully functional Start, Pause/Resume, Reset buttons
- Toggle logic added to Pause button via `app.py`
- All known glitches resolved (stacked timer loops, resume issue)
- UI layout stable and styled using centralized theme
- 
## üß± Refactor Milestone ‚Äî Version 2.0-alpha (2025-05-04)

- Replaced `TimerController` with modular `TimerEngine`
- Logic now decoupled from UI via clean callback functions (`update_display_cb`, `session_complete_cb`)
- Implemented tick-loop in `app.py` using `after()` instead of internal loops
- Enabled Pause/Resume functionality using a toggle button with internal state
- All prior bugs resolved (timer stacking, resume not working)
- System now testable without GUI dependencies

## [2025-05-04] - Added Session Logging System

**Added**
- `logger.py` module under `pomodoro/` for centralized session logging.
- Logging uses CSV file format for simplicity and analysis compatibility.
- CSV file is auto-created if missing (`data/session.csv`) and includes header.

**Changed**
- Modified `session_complete_cb()` in `app.py` to call `log_session()` with session type, timestamp, and number.

**Notes**
- This lays the groundwork for the upcoming analytics dashboard.

## üìÖ 2025-05-06

**Work Done:**
- Finalized `analytics.py` as production-ready module
- Integrated logic based on actual logger schema with dynamic duration support
- Implemented grouping for sessions by day, type totals, and recent summaries
- Added streak calculation (consecutive session days)
- Verified full compatibility with existing logger data

**Decisions Made:**
- Deferred task-aware `Session` tracking (e.g., `task_name`) to future milestone
- Will revisit post-MVP once core analytics and UI are complete
- Logged this plan under Mother Chat‚Äôs roadmap

**Next Steps:**
- Begin visual integration of analytics output into Analytics screen
- Connect computed summaries to UI components and dashboards

## üìÖ 2025-05-07

### üß± Refactored:
- Extracted `render_analytics_screen()` from `app.py` into a new modular file: `screens/analytics_screen.py`
- Created `screens/` directory to house modular UI definitions for each screen
- This change aligns with our earlier modularization (e.g., `timer_engine.py`) and keeps `app.py` clean and maintainable

## üìÖ 2025-05-07 (Midday Log)

### üß± Refactored:
- Moved the global `theme` dictionary out of `app.py` and into a new module: `pomodoro/theme.py`
- All GUI modules now access it via: `from pomodoro.theme import theme`
- This ensures a single source of truth for UI styling, improves modularity, and avoids circular imports

### üß© Planned:
- `theme_manager.py` will be used in a later phase to support dynamic theming (e.g., Light/Dark mode, persistent settings)
## üìÖ 2025-05-09

### ‚úÖ Analytics Screen ‚Äì Scrollable Layout Finalization

**Work Done:**
- Debugged the broken scrolling layout in `analytics_screen.py` with external help (partner).
- Implemented a `Canvas + Scrollbar + Frame` structure that now scrolls the full Analytics screen vertically.
- Bound the width of the scroll window dynamically to match canvas resize.
- Corrected layout hierarchy and `rowconfigure` settings to allow frame expansion.
- Converted placeholder debug layout into a working version with:
  - Sessions per Day bar chart
  - Time Distribution pie chart
  - Streak metrics
  - 7-Day Activity overview
  - Session History viewer (Treeview)

**Decisions Made:**
- Scrollable layout will be the default Analytics mode until full-screen dashboard layout is ready.
- Toggle logic will be added in v1.3.x for switching between dashboard vs scroll mode.
- `use_mock` now propagated cleanly from `app.py` for consistent data display.

**Next Steps:**
- Freeze layout for scrollable analytics
- Begin planning dashboard mode toggle

## üìÖ 2025-05-10

### ‚úÖ Session Label Fix + Per-Type Session Tracking

**Work Done:**
- Added dynamic session labeling (`Work Session 1`, etc.) using per-type counters
- Introduced `session_counts` dictionary to track number of each session type
- Added `work_sessions_completed` to correctly trigger Long Break after every 4 Work sessions
- Updated Start and Complete callbacks to reflect new session label format
- Updated `reset_session()` to clear all counters and labels

**Decisions Made:**
- Session number in label is now per-type, not global
- Logging session_number now uses accurate per-type count (via `session_counts`)
- Analytics backend does not need changes, but logger behavior was adjusted

**Next Steps:**
- Style polish for Treeview in Session History Viewer
- Begin `v1.3` dashboard layout (brick wall style)
