**Next Steps:**
- Refactor layout of control buttons (Start, Pause, Reset) to bottom frame horizontally.
- Reintroduce `Work Session` label and placeholder for tomato visual.
- Isolate and modularize timer logic.
- 
## 📅 2025-05-04 – Mid-Day Update

- Refactored `app.py` to move all timer-related logic into `timer.py` as a class-based module.
- Connected `TimerController` with GUI layout cleanly.
- Implemented `Start`, `Pause`, `Resume`, and `Reset` functionalities via buttons.
- Introduced `toggle_pause()` in `app.py` to switch Pause/Resume states with button text updates.
- Verified correct timer flow and bug-free behavior with modular design.


## 📌 Milestone – Version 1.0 (2025-05-04)

- Modular architecture implemented with separation between UI (`app.py`) and logic (`timer.py`)
- Timer logic encapsulated in `TimerController` class
- Fully functional Start, Pause/Resume, Reset buttons
- Toggle logic added to Pause button via `app.py`
- All known glitches resolved (stacked timer loops, resume issue)
- UI layout stable and styled using centralized theme
- 
## 🧱 Refactor Milestone — Version 2.0-alpha (2025-05-04)

- Replaced `TimerController` with modular `TimerEngine`
- Logic now decoupled from UI via clean callback functions (`update_display_cb`, `session_complete_cb`)
- Implemented tick-loop in `app.py` using `after()` instead of internal loops
- Enabled Pause/Resume functionality using a toggle button with internal state
- All prior bugs resolved (timer stacking, resume not working)
- System now testable without GUI dependencies

## [2025-05-04] - Added Session Logging System

**Added**
- `logger.py` module under `pomodoro/` for centralized session logging.
- Logging uses CSV file format for simplicity and analysis compatibility.
- CSV file is auto-created if missing (`data/session.csv`) and includes header.

**Changed**
- Modified `session_complete_cb()` in `app.py` to call `log_session()` with session type, timestamp, and number.

**Notes**
- This lays the groundwork for the upcoming analytics dashboard.

## 📅 2025-05-06

**Work Done:**
- Finalized `analytics.py` as production-ready module
- Integrated logic based on actual logger schema with dynamic duration support
- Implemented grouping for sessions by day, type totals, and recent summaries
- Added streak calculation (consecutive session days)
- Verified full compatibility with existing logger data

**Decisions Made:**
- Deferred task-aware `Session` tracking (e.g., `task_name`) to future milestone
- Will revisit post-MVP once core analytics and UI are complete
- Logged this plan under Mother Chat’s roadmap

**Next Steps:**
- Begin visual integration of analytics output into Analytics screen
- Connect computed summaries to UI components and dashboards

## 📅 2025-05-07

### 🧱 Refactored:
- Extracted `render_analytics_screen()` from `app.py` into a new modular file: `screens/analytics_screen.py`
- Created `screens/` directory to house modular UI definitions for each screen
- This change aligns with our earlier modularization (e.g., `timer_engine.py`) and keeps `app.py` clean and maintainable

## 📅 2025-05-07 (Midday Log)

### 🧱 Refactored:
- Moved the global `theme` dictionary out of `app.py` and into a new module: `pomodoro/theme.py`
- All GUI modules now access it via: `from pomodoro.theme import theme`
- This ensures a single source of truth for UI styling, improves modularity, and avoids circular imports

### 🧩 Planned:
- `theme_manager.py` will be used in a later phase to support dynamic theming (e.g., Light/Dark mode, persistent settings)

## 📅 2025-05-11

**Work Done:**
- Reviewed faulty external implementation of analytics layout toggle
- Rebuilt `render_analytics_screen()` to dynamically switch between scroll and dashboard layout
- Finalized brick-wall dashboard layout (`render_dashboard_layout`) with correct section grid placement
- Repaired scrollable layout with working scrollbar, mousewheel bindings, dynamic `scrollregion`
- Validated canvas resizing and element rendering across modes

**Decisions Made:**
- Toggle based on `parent_frame.winfo_width() >= 900` is sufficient for switching
- Will continue refining visuals, but layout logic is now milestone-complete

**Next Steps:**
- Begin task label selector (v1.3)
- Apply Treeview styling polish
- Explore user toggles in Settings for layout preference
"""
- ## 📅 2025-05-12

**Work Done:**
- Finalized Task Selector upgrade to a new **Task Plan** layout with session goal support.
- Added two fields: `task_var` (StringVar) and `task_session_goal` (IntVar), placed within a "Task Plan" LabelFrame on Home screen.
- Ensured UI layout harmony by slotting Task Plan into row 5 between the session label and control buttons.
- Designed the internal grid with labels and input fields for Task Name and # of Sessions, using ttk.Entry and ttk.Spinbox respectively.
- Decided that `task_var` and session goal will persist until manually changed or depleted.
- Chose not to alter logger schema — session log continues to log each Work session with the task active at that time.

**Decisions Made:**
- Auto-clearing the task field after each session was dropped in favor of letting users plan how many Pomodoros a task should last.
- Logger will not track the planned session count — only actual completed sessions per task.
- Task field remains free-form (`ttk.Entry`) for now; dropdowns and saved task lists may come in v1.5.

**Next Steps:**
- Notify Code Chat to wire up `task_sessions_remaining` logic:
  - On Start: capture task + session count.
  - On each Work session complete: decrement.
  - If counter hits 0 → clear task_var and session goal.
- Prepare for upcoming Treeview visual polish and task-aware analytics grouping.

## 📅 2025-05-13

**Work Done:**
- Implemented full Task Plan logic in `app.py`:
  - `task_var` and `task_session_goal` added as shared state
  - On Start, task name and number of sessions are captured
  - `current_task` and `task_session_remaining` tracked internally
  - After each Work session, task is logged and counter decremented
  - Task fields auto-clear when planned session count is exhausted
- Integrated into session lifecycle without altering logger structure
- Verified correct behavior across session switches (Work → Break → Work)

**Decisions Made:**
- Task and session goal fields persist between sessions by default
- Task name is only logged during Work sessions
- Field-clearing occurs only after planned Pomodoros complete
- Short/Long Breaks log an empty task by design

**Next Steps:**
- Notify Analytics Team that `task` values are now available in real logs
- Begin Treeview visual polish for the Analytics screen
- Add optional setting to remember last task name across app sessions

## 📅 2025-05-13 (End-of-Day)

**Work Done:**
- Fully integrated Task Plan logic in `app.py`:
  - Task name (`task_var`) and session goal (`task_session_goal`) inputs now operational.
  - Session logging seamlessly integrated; tasks auto-clear after reaching planned session count.
  - Ensured backward compatibility—no logger schema changes needed.
- Finalized Dashboard Analytics structure for clarity:
  - Introduced a 7-Day Activity Overview (line chart) replacing stacked bars for clearer trends.
  - Implemented placeholders for task-specific overlays and future interactivity.
- Completed a refined placeholder dashboard structure with precise `.grid()` placement:
  - `task_freq` spans multiple rows to match height visually.
  - Verified smooth toggle between scrollable and dashboard modes.

**Tech Enhancements:**
- Added `draw_line_chart()` to `charts.py` for multi-line trend visualizations.
- Expanded analytics summarizers:
  - `summarize_daily_by_type()` and `summarize_daily_for_tasks()` added.
- Enhanced mock data to fully support task analytics.

**Decisions Made:**
- Confirmed layout structure optimized for task analytics and visual hierarchy.
- Task field resets only upon reaching the specified session goal.

**Next Steps:**
- Add interactive task-selection dropdown for trend overlays.
- Complete visual polish for Treeview (spacing, colors, tooltips).
- Discuss and implement persistent task memory (most recent task name).
- Enable mock-to-real data toggling in analytics.

## 📅 2025-05-14

**Work Done:**
- Completed full implementation of final v1.3 dashboard layout:
  - Refined 3×4 grid with clear separation of task analytics, usage trends, streaks, and session history.
  - Adjusted `rowconfigure` and `columnconfigure` weights for visual hierarchy.
  - `Task Frequency` chart now spans two rows to balance height with surrounding visuals.
- Implemented new `7-Day Activity Overview` using `draw_line_chart()`:
  - Shows trends of Work, Short Break, and Long Break across the last 7 days.
  - Dropdown added to overlay task-specific trends using `summarize_daily_for_tasks()`.
- Updated scrollable layout to match new line chart and task interactivity.
- Enhanced `charts.py` with `draw_line_chart()` utility:
  - Multi-line support, clear legends, gridlines, responsive labels.
- Expanded `mock_data.py` to include:
  - Mock `per_task_time`, `task_frequency`, `daily_by_type` for all chart previews.
- Verified `use_mock=True` compatibility across all modules.

**Decisions Made:**
- Final dashboard layout approved and locked for v1.3
- Blitting enabled for smoother chart rendering
- Streak cards and chart font sizes made consistent with theme

**Next Steps:**
- Begin v1.4 milestone:
  - Trend overlay for multiple tasks
  - Treeview polish (tooltips, colors, column width)
  - Optional: persistent task tracking

## 📅 2025-05-15 – Structural Refactor & Feature Recovery

**Work Done:**
- Split `app.py` into modular files: `layout.py`, `navigation.py`, `session_manager.py`, `home_screen.py`, etc.
- Refactored `home_screen.py` with `rowconfigure(minsize=...)` to fix UI grid issues.
- Modularized bottom nav (`create_bottom_controls`) for cleaner state handling.
- Implemented a resilient, filtered `ttk.Combobox` for task input with live task suggestion.
- Cleaned up `task_memory.py`: added safe JSON loading, auto-pruning, and fallback.
- Fixed chart crash bug by ensuring pivot tables always contain expected session type columns.
- Restored full **Resume Session** logic via `SessionManager`, including persistence sync and state restoration.

**Fixes:**
- Task memory was not sorted or limited → now corrected.
- Session type dropdown previously glitched UI → now stable.
- Task tracking flow was breaking during pause/resume → now unified with `session_manager`.

**Current Status:**
- No crashes, no layout bugs, full analytics screen working, resume timer stable.
- Feature development may now resume (starting with Subtask Planner).


## 📅 2025-05-18

**Work Done:**
- Investigated and resolved a series of layout and resizing bugs affecting the analytics screen.
- Patched a `KeyError` in the scrollable view's 7-day trend chart caused by missing session type columns.
- Fixed canvas width not expanding on window resize by re-applying `canvas.itemconfig(...)`.
- Restored `on_canvas_configure` and `on_container_configure` bindings removed in a prior refactor.
- Corrected debounce logic used for layout switching; the `after_cancel()` handle was mis-scoped.
- Introduced DPI scaling adjustments for high-resolution screens using `SetProcessDpiAwareness(1)` and `tk.call(...)`.
- Final stabilization involved syncing layout logic with canvas bindings and chart logic to ensure both width and height now resize responsively.

**Decisions Made:**
- “Work”, “Short Break”, and “Long Break” traces are now always padded in the line chart for visual consistency.
- Scrollable and dashboard layout switching now uses a clean debounce trigger on window width.
- DPI scaling remains manual until layout auto-adjustments are proven stable across OS types.

**Next Steps:**
- Begin implementation of the End Session feature and incomplete session logging.
- Move forward with Subtask Planner module creation and UI toggle integration.


## 📅 2025-05-19

**Work Done:**
- Implemented lazy rendering for the Analytics screen to prevent UI layout blocking during startup.
- Deferred `render_analytics_screen()` until the user first navigates to the Analytics tab.
- Integrated logic into navigation to detect first-time activation and trigger rendering.
- Verified that window width and height can now expand fluidly across all screens.
- Slight lag remains on first render of Analytics, but it no longer interferes with root window geometry.

**Decisions Made:**
- Lazy rendering is sufficient for current performance requirements and has unblocked layout constraints.
- Deeper optimization (e.g., threading or render batching) deferred until post-v1.4 milestone.

**Next Steps:**
- Begin implementation of the End Session feature and session window tracking.
- Coordinate with Code
## 📅 2025-05-21

**Work Done:**
- Replaced the separate Start and End session flow with a unified button that dynamically changes label, color, and behavior based on session state.
- Button now switches from "Start" (green) to "End Session" (red) once a session begins. Returns to "Start" after reset or manual end.
- Styling logic centralized in `theme.py` via new `button_start` and `button_end` keys.
- Integrated into `SessionManager` via `set_start_button_state()` for consistency across state transitions.

- Implemented `end_session()` functionality:
  - Captures `start_time`, `end_time`, and `duration_minutes`
  - Marks the session as `completed=False` if manually ended early
  - Logs the session and resets state cleanly
  - Increments session number even on manual end to ensure continuity

- Updated `logger.py` to support new `completed` field:
  - Defaults to `True` for normal completions
  - Converts Boolean to `1` or `0` for CSV
  - Ensures schema remains stable and backward-compatible

- Fixed file path issue with `session.csv`:
  - Previously wrote to wrong location if app run from subdirectory
  - Introduced `PROJECT_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent`
  - Ensures log path is always rooted at top-level `data/` directory

**Decisions Made:**
- Keeping unified button over multiple controls simplifies user experience and layout
- Logging structure now fully supports both complete and interrupted sessions

**Next Steps:**
- Consider use of `completed` flag in analytics summary generation
- Add optional visual indicators for incomplete sessions in session history
- Cache rendered charts for performance when revisiting Analytics screen

## 📅 2025-05-23

**Work Done:**
- Completed implementation of the Task Session Goal Completion dialog flow.
- When `task_session_goal` reaches 0 after a Work session:
  - Timer now pauses automatically
  - User is presented with a modal prompt offering:
    1. Start a New Task
    2. Add More Sessions to This Task
    3. Continue Without a Task
- Implemented full flow control logic to prevent next session from starting until the dialog resolves.

**Technical Changes:**
- Hooked dialog into `session_complete_cb()` to trigger decision point before `start_next_session()`
- Used `Toplevel()` window with `grab_set()` to enforce modal behavior
- Added Spinbox for inputting additional sessions when continuing a task
- Ensured correct timer label updates, session state resets, and session count increments
- Fixed major tick loop bug
## 📅 2025-05-24

**Work Done:**
- Implemented Phase 1 of Subtask Planner (v1.4.1 milestone).
- Users can now optionally attach subtasks to a task. Subtasks are stored persistently in `user_tasks.json` and displayed in a collapsible UI panel beneath the Task Plan section.

**Modules Created:**
- `subtask_engine.py`: defines subtask schema, storage logic, and utility functions.
- `subtask_ui.py`: renders read-only panel displaying current subtasks for the active task.
- `logger.py`: extended to accept optional `subtask` field in session logs.

**UI Integration:**
- Subtask panel added to `home_screen.py` at `row=5`.
- Expand/collapse toggle activates display of subtask list with: `Name | Goal | Done`.

**Technical Fixes:**
- Corrected file path for saving `user_tasks.json` (now saved under `/data/`)
- Fixed missing return from `render_subtask_panel()`
- Added diagnostics to confirm read/write behavior
- Validated task-subtask sync via `manager.task_var`

**Next Steps:**
- Enable Add/Edit/Delete for subtasks
- Link subtask progress to session completion
- Later: feed subtask data into analytics/streak logic

## 📅 2025-05-26

**Work Done:**
- Completed core logic for Subtask Planner Phase 2. All essential lifecycle methods (`add_subtask`, `edit_subtask`, `delete_subtask`, `mark_subtask_progress`, `reset_subtasks`) are now implemented and tested.
- `mark_subtask_progress()` is invoked from `session_complete_cb()` to track subtask advancement. Returned names are used for session logging and UI refresh.
- Logger updated to accept and log an optional `subtask` field in `session.csv`.
- Session flow now tracks active subtasks during Work sessions. Auto-increments subtask progress and only pauses when all subtasks are complete.
- Debug statements added for traceability: JSON writes, duplicate name rejections, and subtask session marking.

**Files Modified:**
- `pomodoro/subtask_engine.py`: Full CRUD methods, `_save_all()` helper, and duplicate guard implemented
- `pomodoro/subtask_ui.py`: Scaffolded render panel with dynamic frame wiring
- `core/session_manager.py`: Integrated subtask progress and pause control
- `pomodoro/logger.py`: Added subtask support to CSV schema
- `data/user_tasks.json`: Nested subtask format introduced and validated

**Next Steps:**

- Added post-session reflection prompt via `show_reflection_prompt()` shown after Work sessions
- Captures `focus_rating (1–5)`, `session_notes`, and calculates `intent_fulfilled = True` if rating ≥ 4
- Stored reflection fields temporarily in `SessionManager`:
  - `_last_focus_rating`
  - `_last_reflection_notes`
  - `_last_session_success`
- Reflection and intent prompt flows are handled via `reflection.py`, now fully modular
- Updated `router.py` to call reflection prompt from `session_complete_cb()` after Work sessions

## 📅 2025-06-22
**Work Done:**
- Modularized `SessionManager` into dedicated mixin modules
- Added missing methods (`update_display_cb`, `get_all_task_names`, `set_subtask_editable`)
- Updated `app.py` to import unified `SessionManager` from `sess_manager.py`
- Refined `on_task_fetched` logic to respect manual session goals

**Decisions Made:**
- Use mixin pattern for separation of UI, timer, tasks, routing, dialogs
- Keep UI setup in `session_base` and business logic in `session_router`

**Next Steps:**
- Deprecate old `session_manager.py`
- Add automated tests for each mixin
- Document new module responsibilities in project README
- Validate full app behavior across all screens

## 📅 2025-08-10 — v1.5 Kickoff (Planning & Branch Hygiene)

**Work Done**
- Created working branch `ui-agnostic-v1.5` from `main`.
- Tagged rollback point on `main` as `pre-v1.5-2025-08-10`.
- Created snapshot branch `ui-agnostic-main-snapshot-2025-08-10` from `main`.
- Updated **CHANGELOG.md**, **WORKLOG.md**, **debug_log.md** to open v1.5 scope.
- Scoped v1.5 priorities:
  - Analytics expansion: add `focus_rating`, `intent_text`, `reflection_notes` to `session.csv` (non-breaking).
  - Heatmap readiness: confirm reliable `start_time` & `end_time` logging for behavior mapping.
  - Hooks for gamification (session-count unlocks) and theming groundwork.

**Decisions**
- Enforce UI‑agnostic rule: all logic changes live in `engine/` and analytics modules; no Tkinter dependencies.
- Re‑affirm Logs‑First rule: no merges without updated CHANGELOG / WORKLOG / debug_log.

**Next Steps**
- Extend `logger.py` to write optional fields (`focus_rating`, `intent_text`, `reflection_notes`) and reconfirm `start_time`/`end_time` consistency.
- Update analytics (e.g., `analytics.py`, charts) to surface new fields: rating distributions, intent adherence, notes tagging.
- Add backward‑compatible CSV readers and tests; analytics must tolerate missing columns.
- Prepare PR from `ui-agnostic-v1.5` → `main` once docs land.
