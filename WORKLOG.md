Daily progress journal for the Pomodoro Productivity App.

---

## 2025-04-28
**Work Done:**
- Updated README.md to reflect new project vision
- Created CHANGELOG.md, ASK.md, WORKLOG.md templates
- Planned full project structure and goals

**Decisions:**
- Follow Google Data Analytics Process (Ask ‚Üí Prepare ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Share ‚Üí Act)
- Plan future analytics and reporting features now

**Next Steps:**
- Commit all initial documentation
- Begin building base Tkinter window
## 2025-05-03
**Work Done:**
- Finalized and tested base UI layout with top, middle, and bottom frames.
- Implemented navigation button switching logic using `.grid()` and `tkraise()`.
- Applied centralized theme dictionary for styling consistency.
- Integrated initial countdown functionality via `start_countdown()` and `after()` method.
- Identified layout deviations caused by premature feature additions from Learning Chat.
- Re-aligned structure to match UI/UX plan before further logic integration.

**Decisions:**
- Timer logic will be preserved but temporarily decoupled from layout while UI cleanup proceeds.
- Feature additions (like session selection dropdown) will be relocated or reintroduced after design stabilization.

**Next Steps:**
- Refactor layout of control buttons (Start, Pause, Reset) to bottom frame horizontally.
- Reintroduce `Work Session` label and placeholder for tomato visual.
- Isolate and modularize timer logic.
- 
## üìÖ 2025-05-04 ‚Äì Mid-Day Update

- Refactored `app.py` to move all timer-related logic into `timer.py` as a class-based module.
- Connected `TimerController` with GUI layout cleanly.
- Implemented `Start`, `Pause`, `Resume`, and `Reset` functionalities via buttons.
- Introduced `toggle_pause()` in `app.py` to switch Pause/Resume states with button text updates.
- Verified correct timer flow and bug-free behavior with modular design.


## üìå Milestone ‚Äì Version 1.0 (2025-05-04)

- Modular architecture implemented with separation between UI (`app.py`) and logic (`timer.py`)
- Timer logic encapsulated in `TimerController` class
- Fully functional Start, Pause/Resume, Reset buttons
- Toggle logic added to Pause button via `app.py`
- All known glitches resolved (stacked timer loops, resume issue)
- UI layout stable and styled using centralized theme
- 
## üß± Refactor Milestone ‚Äî Version 2.0-alpha (2025-05-04)

- Replaced `TimerController` with modular `TimerEngine`
- Logic now decoupled from UI via clean callback functions (`update_display_cb`, `session_complete_cb`)
- Implemented tick-loop in `app.py` using `after()` instead of internal loops
- Enabled Pause/Resume functionality using a toggle button with internal state
- All prior bugs resolved (timer stacking, resume not working)
- System now testable without GUI dependencies

## [2025-05-04] - Added Session Logging System

**Added**
- `logger.py` module under `pomodoro/` for centralized session logging.
- Logging uses CSV file format for simplicity and analysis compatibility.
- CSV file is auto-created if missing (`data/session.csv`) and includes header.

**Changed**
- Modified `session_complete_cb()` in `app.py` to call `log_session()` with session type, timestamp, and number.

**Notes**
- This lays the groundwork for the upcoming analytics dashboard.
