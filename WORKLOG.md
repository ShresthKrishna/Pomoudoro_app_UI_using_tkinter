## 2025-05-03
**Work Done:**
- Finalized and tested base UI layout with top, middle, and bottom frames.
- Implemented navigation button switching logic using `.grid()` and `tkraise()`.
- Applied centralized theme dictionary for styling consistency.
- Integrated initial countdown functionality via `start_countdown()` and `after()` method.
- Identified layout deviations caused by premature feature additions from Learning Chat.
- Re-aligned structure to match UI/UX plan before further logic integration.

**Decisions:**
- Timer logic will be preserved but temporarily decoupled from layout while UI cleanup proceeds.
- Feature additions (like session selection dropdown) will be relocated or reintroduced after design stabilization.

**Next Steps:**
- Refactor layout of control buttons (Start, Pause, Reset) to bottom frame horizontally.
- Reintroduce `Work Session` label and placeholder for tomato visual.
- Isolate and modularize timer logic.
