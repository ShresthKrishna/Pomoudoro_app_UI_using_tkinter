# 📜 Debug Log
### 🐞 [April 30, 2025] – Frame Layout & Label Glitch
- **Issue**: Labels not scaling, frames not raising on button click
- **Fix**: Used `.grid()` layout with `tkraise()` logic inside `show_frame()` to enable navigation and responsiveness

### 🐞 [May 3, 2025] – Feature Flow Disruption from Learning Chat
- **Issue**: Learning chat introduced premature logic (timer, session dropdown) that conflicted with UI/UX design plans.
- **Fix**: Preserved functional logic but began UI cleanup by refactoring layout, especially control buttons and screen alignment. Realigned with planned workflow.
## 🐞 [May 3, 2025]

### ✅ Fixed: Start Button Glitch
- Issue: Pressing “Start” multiple times triggered overlapping `after()` loops.
- Fix: Guard added using `self.timer_id` to ensure only one countdown runs at a time.

### ✅ Fixed: Resume Function Inactive
- Issue: Clicking “Pause” halted timer, but did not resume when clicked again.
- Fix: Added `toggle_pause()` logic in `app.py` with `nonlocal` flag and `.config()` for dynamic text switch.

## ✅ Milestone: All listed bugs resolved in v1.0

## [2025-05-04] Timer Logic Refactor Debug Summary

- ✅ Timer stacking issue resolved by checking `is_running` in `start()`
- ✅ Resume now works via dedicated `resume()` method and pause toggle logic in `app.py`
- ✅ Remaining time now updates cleanly through `update_display_cb`
- ✅ Refactor allows headless testing; no Tkinter dependency in core logic

## [2025-05-04] - Session Logging Integration

### Observations
- Logging triggered cleanly at the end of each session via callback.
- `Path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` ensures folder existence — no FileNotFoundError.

### Tests Conducted
- Multiple sessions completed to test append behavior.
- CSV confirms consistent structure and no header duplication.

### Known Limitations
- Currently appends without limits — no cap on file size.
- Data is raw; not yet visualized or summarized in-app.

### To Revisit
- Once analytics is live, validate whether the logger output aligns with charts and summaries.


### 🐞 [May 11, 2025] – Scroll & Layout Toggle Discrepancy

**Issue**:
- Alternate version of `analytics_screen.py` added layout toggle between scroll and dashboard mode, but broke agreed GUI structure.
- Scrollbar existed but did not work — canvas height never expanded, scrollregion never updated.

**Fix**:
- Reimplemented scroll layout using correct `Canvas + Frame + Scrollbar` structure.
- Used `create_window()` and width binding.
- Reintegrated `render_scrollable_layout()` and `render_dashboard_layout()` with proper toggle logic via `parent_frame.winfo_width()`.

**Status**:
✅ Fixed. Dynamic switching works cleanly. Both layouts follow design structure.

## 📅 2025-05-13 – Dashboard & Task Plan Integration Validation

**Feature Validations:**
- Confirmed Task Plan logic correctly tracks session counts and resets appropriately.
- Ensured no logging issues with empty tasks during breaks.
- Dashboard analytics layout verified against UI proposal (row-column spanning, widget alignment).

**Debugging Notes:**
- Verified responsive layout toggle (`>=900px`) without visual glitches.
- Confirmed all new summary functions (`analytics.py`) handle mock and real data correctly.

**No critical issues or regressions identified.**

## 📅 2025-05-15 – Stability Fix Log

**Resolved Issues:**
- 🔥 [Critical] `KeyError: 'daily_by_type'` → caused by incomplete mock summaries; patched mock return values.
- 🔧 [Visual] Task entry used `ttk.Entry` → replaced with `ttk.Combobox` + dynamic filtering to prevent mistypes and encourage reuse.
- 🧠 [State Loss] Resume timer state was not syncing across UI and task memory → consolidated under `session_manager`.
- 🎯 [UI Bug] Session type dropdown and session label were overlapping → corrected via `rowconfigure(minsize)` constraints.

**Root Cause Summary:**
- Several untracked changes during Git issues led to rollback of resume, task tracking, and combobox logic. These have now been reconstructed, modularized, and documented.
## 🐞 2025-05-18 – debug_log.md

**Issue 1**: KeyError in scrollable 7-day chart  
- Cause: Summary DataFrame sometimes lacked “Work” or other session keys.  
- Fix: Chart function now pads missing columns with zero-count data.

**Issue 2**: Canvas width did not adjust on window resize  
- Cause: Width was never updated using `canvas.itemconfig()` after `create_window()`.  
- Fix: Bound canvas width to frame container and dynamically updated it on `<Configure>`.

**Issue 3**: Removed bindings during refactor  
- Cause: Scrollregion and window width weren’t updating due to missing canvas/frame binding logic.  
- Fix: Restored `on_canvas_configure` and `on_container_configure` to fix dynamic layout.

**Issue 4**: Mis-scoped debounce handler  
- Cause: `resize_job[]` handle wasn't safely scoped, leading to invalid callback errors.  
- Fix: Moved debounce logic to outer scope; now cancels and replaces cleanly.

**Issue 5**: DPI scaling unrelated to layout flow  
- Cause: Font sharpness improved via OS DPI settings, but layout size remained unaffected.  
- Fix: DPI tweaks retained, but layout corrected using proper column/row configuration.
