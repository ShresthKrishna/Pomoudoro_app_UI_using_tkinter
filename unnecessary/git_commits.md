ðŸ§¹ Refactored:

- Centralized mock analytics summaries into new `mock_data.py`
- Removed hardcoded mock logic from `analytics.py`

ðŸ“š Reviewed:
- Conducted full-code audit across `app.py`, `analytics_screen.py`, `timer_engine.py`, `logger.py`, etc.
- Identified styling, layout, and modularity inconsistencies for future GUI Cleanup Phase

ðŸ“„ Updated:
- WORKLOG.md (midday + final logs)
- PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md (mock_data.py, analytics_screen.py, theme.py)
- README.md (theming and screen modularization)

ðŸ”¥ Ready for next phase: visual polish + interactivity
