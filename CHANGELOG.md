- `analytics_screen.py`: Introduced two new chart sections in the scrollable layout:
  - **Top Tasks by Time** (horizontal bar chart)
  - **Task Frequency Breakdown** (pie chart)

### **Changed**
- `generate_all_summaries()` now includes `per_task_time` and `task_frequency` keys for downstream chart rendering.
- All chart calls in `analytics_screen.py` explicitly specify key mappings to align with flexible chart function signatures.
- Chart functions are now resilient to column mismatches and default to human-readable axis titles.

### **Fixed**
- Handled `KeyError` when mock summaries lacked expected keys for task-based charts.
- Clarified inconsistent return types in analytics helpers with updated type hints.
- Improved UI safety: pie/bar charts now fail gracefully when passed empty or malformed data.

- `session_manager.py` to centralize resume + session state handling
- Modular bottom controls (start/pause/reset)

**Changed:**

**Fixed**
- `KeyError` when summary data omitted session types in trend charts.
- Canvas and inner frame width mismatch resolved with proper window bindings.
- Restored dynamic scrollregion resizing after missing `<Configure>` events were re-bound.
- Prevented layout flicker during resize by stabilizing debounce and redraw order.

## üêû 2025-05-19 ‚Äì Lazy Rendering Fix for Analytics Screen

**Issue**: Analytics screen blocked window expansion on launch  
- Cause: Initial rendering involved multiple charts, summary generation, and heavy Matplotlib operations inside `render_analytics_screen()`, which delayed root layout expansion.
- Fix: Deferred rendering until navigation to the Analytics screen using a lazy load trigger. Layout now initializes fully before rendering begins.

**Result**:
- All screens now allow proper width and height expansion on drag.
- Slight delay on first Analytics load is acceptable and non-blocking.
- No regressions observed in navigation, DPI scaling, or layout responsiveness.

## [v1.4-pre] ‚Äì 2025-05-21

### Added
- Unified Start/End session button with dynamic label and style based on session state

- Confirmed CSV file write behavior and schema consistency across manual and automatic ends

### Notes
- Logging now fully supports session duration and intent integrity
- Button visual behavior is consistent with task state and timer phase

  - Add more sessions to the current task
  - Continue without any task

### Fixed
- Timer tick loop no longer runs multiple instances due to incorrect `after()` syntax
- Timer label and duration state now correctly update after manual task reset
- Session continuation logic paused automatically after task plan completes

### Improved
- Manual End Session and Task Completion now integrated smoothly
- User control over session lifecycle has been fully implemented
## [v1.4.1-pre] ‚Äì 2025-05-23

### Added
- Subtask Planner scaffolding and UI rendering

## üêû [May 26, 2025] ‚Äì Subtask Engine and Session Flow Integration

**Issue**: Subtask logic not yet integrated into session completion  
- Fix: `mark_subtask_progress()` now called inside `session_complete_cb()`  
- Result: Active subtask is progressed, and `completed` count is updated in JSON

**Issue**: No subtask field in logger output  
- Fix: `logger.log_session()` updated to accept and log `subtask` name  
- Result: `session.csv` now includes optional `subtask` field per row

**Issue**: JSON not saving correctly with complex nesting  
- Fix: Created atomic `_save_all()` with debug instrumentation for path writes  
- Added guards for duplicate subtask names per task

**Validation**:

## [2025-06-16] - v1.4.3 (UI-Agnostic Routing & SessionManager Refactor)

### Added
- `router.py`: Modular session routing functions `pause_for_task_decision()` and `resume_post_task()` now decoupled from `SessionManager`
- Routing logic now handles post-session decision-making cleanly across task transitions

### Changed
- `SessionManager.on_start()` now delegates to `reflection.py`
- `session_complete_cb()` fully moved into `router.py`

### Fixed
- Cleared stale reflection flags on session reset
- Prevented duplicate modal triggers from session reentry
- Logger format updated to conditionally append reflection fields

## 2025-06-22
**Work Done:**
- Split monolithic `SessionManager` into seven focused mixins:
  - `session_base`, `session_settings`, `session_timer`, `session_tasks`, `session_router`, `session_subtasks`, `session_dialogs`
- Reintroduced missing UI hooks in mixins:
  - `update_display_cb` in `session_timer`
  - `get_all_task_names` in `session_tasks`
- Added `SessionSubtasks` mixin to implement `set_subtask_editable`
- Updated `sess_manager.py` to inherit all mixins; adjusted `app.py` import to `engine.manager.sess_manager`
- Tweaked `on_task_fetched` logic to preserve manual `task_session_goal` values

**Decisions:**
- Adopt mixin-based architecture for clear separation of concerns
- Centralize all UI-related callbacks in `session_base` / `session_timer`
- Retain core routing logic in `session_router` to facilitate future extensions

**Next Steps:**
- Write unit tests for each mixin
- Remove deprecated `session_manager.py` once new modules are stable
- Update README to document new file structure
- Perform end-to-end QA on all dialog flows

## [v1.5.0-start] ‚Äì 2025-08-10

### Added
- **Governance & Safety:** Began v1.5 work on branch `ui-agnostic-v1.5`; created snapshot `ui-agnostic-main-snapshot-2025-08-10`.
- **Rollback:** Tag `pre-v1.5-2025-08-10` on `main` for guaranteed return point.
- **Analytics Scope:** Plan to add `focus_rating`, `intent_text`, `reflection_notes` to `session.csv` and wire into dashboards (heatmap requires consistent `start_time`/`end_time`).

### Changed
- **Process:** Re‚Äëenforced Logs‚ÄëFirst merges and ‚Äúui‚Äëagnostic‚Äù branch naming convention.

### Notes
- No runtime behavior changes today; documentation, planning, and branch safety only.
