## [2025-05-04] - Mid-Day

- Button wiring and toggle logic for Pause/Resume

## [2025-05-04] - Added Session Logging System

### Added
- `logger.py` module under `pomodoro/` for centralized session logging.
- Logging uses CSV file format for simplicity and analysis compatibility.
- CSV file is auto-created if missing (`data/session.csv`) and includes header.

### Changed
- Modified `session_complete_cb()` in `app.py` to call `log_session()` with session type, timestamp, and number.

### Notes

## [2025-05-09] - Scrollable Analytics Layout Implemented

- Dynamic row placement for each analytics block: Bar, Pie, Cards, Chart, Treeview
- Fallback message added to Treeview when session list is empty

### Changed
- `app.py`: Added `use_mock` flag and passed it into `render_analytics_screen`

### Fixed
- Broken scroll behavior where canvas remained in a confined area
- Scrollbar now properly responds to window resizing and content height

## [2025-05-10] - Session Tracking Logic Refactor

### Changed
- Replaced global session counting with per-type session counters
- Long Break trigger logic now based on actual Work sessions completed

### Fixed
- Incorrect session label display (was showing Short Break Session 2 as first break)
- Long Breaks not appearing at all due to faulty modulo logic

### Added
- `session_counts` dictionary
- `work_sessions_completed` tracker
- Updated `reset_session()` to clean internal counters and labels
